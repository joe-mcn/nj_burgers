<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>N & J's Burger Joint started when two college roommates discovered a mutual passion for cooking and serving their community. After graduating they decided to follow their dreams and open a specialty burger restaurant that features great food for a reasonable price and a great atmosphere for the whole family. Since it's opening N & J's Burger Joint has become a favorite in the community it so proudly serves.</p>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>At N & J's Burger Joint our mission is to create a family atmosphere for both our employees and our customers, as well as provide opportunities for aspiring restaurant owners. To do this, we work closely with schools in the surrounding area in order to help us find and hire young people with dreams of making it in the culinary world.</p>
